\section{Access Periodicity} \label{sec:periodicity_stats}
The distributions of coverage periods for all constellations tested were strongly modal, with the majority having one dominant mode. Figure \ref{fig:allfitdist_Heathrow}, from the reference constellation observing the LAX-Heathrow flight, shows a typical distribution. The periods shown all fall within a tight band around the mean, with some outliers and modes to the left and right of the mean. After applying \verb|allfitdist| \cite{sheppard12}, it was found that the Student's t distribution with a location and scale transformation applied, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:allfitdist_Heathrow}. An analysis of the Student's t distribution is given in Appendix \ref{sec:stats}.

For constellations with more than 12 satellites, the extracted parameters from \verb|allfitdist| yielded values for the degrees of freedom, $\nu$, for which the variance is undefined. Empirically, this was observed as the case if the band of most probable periods was too narrow for analysis using the Student's t distribution as the model. In these cases, the narrow variance was considered desirable and so for the purposes of comparative analysis, the `variance' score in the weighted decision matrix was given the highest score, 10.

It was found that for constellations with a lower number of satellites, there was less of a dominant node and more of an even spread of distributions. Figure \ref{fig:allfitdist_Heathrow6sat} shows the histogram for a six-satellite constellation, showing a larger spread of results. In these cases, \verb|allfitdist| yielded different distributions of best fit, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:allfitdist_Heathrow6sat}. Although these fits are not exact, the extracted variance value was considered a good indicator of comparative variance in periodicity. The standard deviations from these distributions were extracted computationally
