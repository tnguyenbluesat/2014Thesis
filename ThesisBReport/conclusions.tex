\section{Conclusions}
The suite of simulations showed that constellations with higher altitude or a higher number of satellites provided more raw coverage time. A higher altitude allowed for a greater sensor footprint, meaning that a trans-oceanic flight would stay `in-view' for longer. Having more satellites simply increases the probability of a satellite being above a trans-oceanic flight at any one point in time.

Despite the geographic coverage performance of high altitude constellations, low altitude constellations showed a marked improvement in signal performance. Lower altitudes represented less distance required to travel by any one ADS-B transmission, resulting in lower signal loss. This effect was dramatic enough such that the lowest altitude constellation performed better than most other constellations as seen in Table \ref{tab:decMatRes}.

The inclination trend analysis suggested that a constellation with all satellites inclined at 90 degrees may represent the best coverage trade-off between the three flights. This inclination represents the best possible geometric configuration for full global coverage. However, the nature of one-dimensional parameter variance in the tests conducted and the weighted decision matrix meant that the 90 degree inclination configuration did not feature in the `best choices'. 
\subsection{Chosen Constellation}
The results from the weighted decision matrix show that a satellite constellation with parameters as defined in Table \ref{tab:18sat_winner} is the best performing space based ADS-B system of those tested. This particular constellation performed strongly in being able to provide a high level of coverage for the three trans-oceanic flights studied in this thesis. A 3D model of this constellation is shown in Figure \ref{fig:18sat_3D} and the ground tracks in Figure \ref{fig:18sat_groundtrack}

This particular result shows that a higher-number of satellites performs more favourably when considering ADS-B coverage requirements. Interestingly, a lower number of satellites in a lower orbit performs almost as well due to dramatically increased communication link performance. The test conducted only examined variation of one parameter at a time and can not provide a conclusion on whether a combination of two or more parameters would result in the most optimal constellation performance.
