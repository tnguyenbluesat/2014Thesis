\section{Raw Results}
From each simulation in STK, two raw data sets were extracted - a series of access times and the link-budget characterisation for the modelled satellite constellation.

\subsection{Access Times}
Access times were output from STK as tables of access periods. Each access period represented a the period of time where the flight in question was able to establish an RF link with a particular overhead satellite. Access time tables were grouped by satellite by flight analysed. Start and stop times were given in fraction of days from January 1st, 1900. A sample of raw data, taken from the reference case from Section \ref{sec:ref_case} is presented in Table \ref{tab:results_access_sample1}. This data shows the first five accesses between a flight from LAX to Heathrow and two of the satellites in the constellation. All results were concatenated and sorted into for further analysis in Section \ref{sec:data_processing}.

\subsection{Link Budget}
Link budget data was sampled by STK every hour. As with the access times, data was grouped per flight per satellite in the constellation. Each sample of data included the transmitted power (EIRP), received frequency, received isotropic power and other link characteristics. A sample of data outputted from STK from one link is given in Table \ref{tab:results_linkbudget_sample1}. This data was taken from the simulation of the reference case from Section \ref{sec:ref_case} and shows the first 10 samples of the link budget data from a communication link between an LAX-Heathrow flight and one of the satellites in the constellation. This data was also concatenated and sorted for further analysis, as presented in Section \ref{sec:data_processing}.
